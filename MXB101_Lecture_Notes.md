a capital letter.

Events can be simple (a single event) or compound (two or more simple
events).

::: definition
The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the sample
space for that experiment and is denoted $\Omega$.

All events $A$ are subsets of $\Omega$, $A \subseteq \Omega$.

::: definition
An intersection between two events $A$ and $B$ describes the set of
outcomes that occur in both $A$ and $B$.

An intersection can be represented using the set operator $A \cup B$.
